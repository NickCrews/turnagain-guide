So you saw Cody Townsend in some ski movie and now you want to ski some spines, huh?
These are probably the best and most easily accessible spines in Alaska,
and maybe North America?

All of these require bootpacking, but some of them are possible to skin up 3/4 of the way.
Most of them have great runouts on wide aprons, which makes the consequences of an
avalanche much less severe.
They are all South facing. In midwinter, the sun doesn't have a huge effect
except on the warmest days. In the springtime though, you need to take the
solar aspect into account, which usually means going early.
