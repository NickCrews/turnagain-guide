As of early season 2024, someone has cut a path through the lower alder fields,
so even with quite low snow, the approach is a fairly easy walk up to the
Iditarod Trail. Once there is a bit more snow at mid season, you can skin the whole way.

When you reach the Iditarod Trail, which sidehills the valley, this is the point where you
have to make a decision as to which side of the creek gulley you want
to follow for the next few hundred vertical feet. The South side of the creek,
underneath Cornbiscuit, is usually easier and more traveled, especially in early season
when the alder fields above are less covered. In the middle of the season, the North path
is just fine, especially as a descent route, which is usually less tracked than
the South side.
