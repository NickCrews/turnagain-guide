This South facing bowl is slightly uphill of [Tincan Common Bowl](./tincan-common-bowl).
It is less popular, and a nice alternative when Common Bowl is crowded.

There is almost always a large cornice on the top of the bowl, with only a few places
where you can sneak around it to enter the bowl. It also is more likely to be wind-loaded
than Common Bowl, so be a little more confident in the avalanche conditions before
you progress from Common Bowl to Hippie Bowl.

You can either just lap the upper bowl, or you can continue over the gradual rollover
all the way down to Center Ridge Valley. This lower section is a little more steep,
and is composed of several large steep gullies with complex bumpy terrain.
It can be quite playful, with chances to ski mini spines, but also makes
it more likely to trigger something on a convexity, and the "funneling" action
can make it more consequential. A very nice linkup for a stable day is to ski
this run all the way to the bottom, and then scooch upvalley to find
something in [The Libraries](./the-libraries).
