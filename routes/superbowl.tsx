        This is commonly used as a final run of the day when exiting from
        the <RouteLink routeID="goldpan-area">Goldpan Area</RouteLink> back to the
        parking lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entry is a little steep, but it isn&apos;t usually too wind-loaded,
        there aren&apos;t any significant rollovers to act as trigger points,
        and the runout is a forgiving wide apron.
        Usually if I have been comfortable skiing in Goldpan,
        I am comfortable skiing Superbowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the bottom, you can get easily get back to the
        <RouteLink routeID="cornbiscuit-parking-lot">Cornbiscuit Parking Lot</RouteLink> or the
        by sidehilling left along the flank of Cornbiscuit until you rejoin
        the <RouteLink routeID="cornbiscuit-uptrack">Cornbiscuit Uptrack</RouteLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also is possible to get back to
        the <RouteLink routeID="sunburst-parking-lot">Sunburst Parking Lot</RouteLink>
        if that is where you parked, although this is a bit more of a pain.
        You should sidehill right along the flank of Magnum
        until you reach the <RouteLink routeID="magnum-front-face">Magnum Front Face</RouteLink>,
        where you can descend to the car.
        This requires some significant sidestepping on skis or a short skin.
