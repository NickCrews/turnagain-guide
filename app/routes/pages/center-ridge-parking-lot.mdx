title: Center Ridge Parking Lot
---

A large, off-highway parking lot. This is most often used if you are planning
on descending from [The Libraries](./the-libraries), [Hippy Bowl](./hippy-bowl),
or somewhere else up center ridge valley, because it's all down hill to here
when skiing down center ridge valley.
It's just a little bit harder to get back to [Tincan Parking Lot](./tincan-parking-lot) from center
ridge valley, requiring a bit of sidestepping (if you are on skis and there is already a track),
or a tiny skin if you are on a splitboard or the snow is deep.

There are bathrooms here, but they are usually closed in winter.
After a big storm, this is one of the later parking lots to get plowed.
This is also a common parking lot for snowmachiners, who overflow here when
their main parking lot across the highway is full.
