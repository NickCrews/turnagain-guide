      <p>
        As of early season 2024, someone has cut a path through the lower alder
        fields, so even with quite low snow, the approach is a fairly easy walk
        up to the Iditarod Trail. Once there is a bit more snow at mid season,
        you can skin the whole way.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you reach the Iditarod Trail, which sidehills the valley, this is
        the point where you have to make a decision as to which side of the
        creek gulley you want to follow for the next few hundred vertical feet.
        The South side of the creek, underneath Cornbiscuit, is usually easier
        and more traveled, especially in early season when the alder fields
        above are less covered. In the middle of the season, the North path is
        just fine, especially as a descent route, which is usually less tracked
        than the South side.
