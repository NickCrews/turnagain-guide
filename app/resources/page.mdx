## Facebook Groups

The [Alaska Backcountry Ski Addiction](https://www.facebook.com/groups/583971298332539/)
Facebook group is a great place to ask questions, share photos, and find partners.
It's probably the most active backcountry skiing group in Alaska.

If you're a woman, a less gatekeepy and bro-y alternative is the
[AK Chicks Who Backcountry Ski/Splitboard](https://www.facebook.com/groups/316805289670797)
Facebook group.

## Strava Heatmap

Use the [Strava Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap?sport=WinterLike&style=winter&terrain=true&labels=true&poi=false&cPhotos=false&gColor=orange&gOpacity=100#9.83/60.7484/-149.1691) to find where people commonly go.
Even if people are secretive about their favorite spots, they still post their tracks to Strava.
If you use GaiaGPS, you can add the Strava Heatmap as a layer
by following [this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/NickCrews/bdd7dc9d5d82003611dce0932a202644).

## Stores

- [AMH](https://www.alaskamountaineering.com/) is a locally owned outdoor store in Anchorage.
  It has a comparable/better selection than REI, especially for sepcialty and technical gear.
- [REI](https://www.rei.com/stores/anchorage.html) is a national outdoor store with a location in Anchorage.
- [Hoarding Marmot](https://www.hoardingmarmot.com/) is a consignment store in Anchorage offering new and used technical gear.
- [Powder Hound Ski Shop](https://www.powderhoundak.com/) is a ski shop in Girdwood.
  They are a little more resort-oriented (since they are at the base of Alyeska),
  so they don't have as wide of a selection of backcountry gear (eg skins)
  as AMH, but otherwise are great.
