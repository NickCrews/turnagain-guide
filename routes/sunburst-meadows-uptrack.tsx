      <p>
        This is the midwinter route that is only possible when the alders are
        fully buried. During early and late season, you should use
        the <RouteLink routeID="sunburst-meadows-uptrack-early">
        Sunburst Meadows Early Season Uptrack</RouteLink>.
        This route is a bit more shorter and avoids the annoying icy gully
        that you encounter on the early season route.
        Also, on the way back down, this is a more consistent downhill slope,
        whereas the early season route requires some schooching in the final meadows
        near the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are trying to keep it chill, the lower alder meadows all along the base
        of Sunburst (and Magnum, Cornbiscuit, and Lipps!) provide some 500 vertical foot
        party laps.
      </p>
