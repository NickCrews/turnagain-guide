      <p>
        This is a pretty easy flat skin along the bottom of Taylor Creek valley,
        until the final pitch up to Taylor Pass.
        It is easy to ride back down this on the way home, no skootching or skinning required.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I rated this as &quot;simple&quot; ATES terrain, it does have
        significant overhead avalanche risk in certain conditions.
        Usually I don&apos;t worry about it, except for either really
        busy days and people above me, or when conditions allow for
        extremely remote triggers, or there is risk of spontaneous
        avalanches (eg heavy precipitation, rapid warming, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        From Taylor Pass, you can turn left (North) and skin (sometimes requires a small
        amount of booting to avoid wind-exposed grass/rocks) up the ridge
        to <RouteLink routeID="sunburst-peak">Sunburst Peak</RouteLink>.
        There is a popular descent from Sunburst Peak back down to Taylor Creek that you can lap.
