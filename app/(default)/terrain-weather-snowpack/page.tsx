      <h1>Terrain, Snowpack, and Weather</h1>
      
      <h2>Terrain</h2>
      <p>
        The Seward Highway tops out in Turnagain Pass at 1000 feet.
        Most parking lots are between 700 and 1000 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treeline is around 2000 feet. Below that, you will find old growth
        temperate rainforest full of large TODO trees.
        Snow will make it through the canopy,
        but often only after falling off the branches in clumpy tree-bombs.
        This means that the snow is usually chunky or icy, making it possible
        to skin but generally unenjoyable to ski.
        In many places, the trees are spaced wide enough that you can passage between
        them without too much difficulty, though there are sometimes devils club or
        blueberry patches that get in yor way, especially during low snow.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Weather</h2>
      
      <h3>Wind</h3>
      <p>
        In many other areas, wind tends to have consistent behavior.
        For example, in the Bozeman MT area, storms often blow in from the West.
        The mountain ranges there are these isolated, discrete zones, surrounded by plains.
        This leads to the winds in the mountains <em>also</em> being relatively consistent from the West,
        throughout the entire forecast zone.
        Everywhere you go on a single day, the windloading is going to be found on the same aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, wind is complex in Turnagain Pass.
        As you travel throughout a day, the prevailing wind might come
        from many different directions, and many different aspects will be windloaded.
        Now, even if the wind aspect is inconsistent between <em>different areas at the same time</em>,
        the wind is often consistent between <em>the same area at different times</em>.
        For example, the cornice on the ridge of Gold Pan always forms on the same side of the
        ridge every year, even if maybe a kilometer away the cornices all form on the other
        side of the ridge.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Rain</h3>
      <p>
        It can rain here. It is common for rainline to climb all the way to 3000 feet
        several times a winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The magic number to pay attention to is 1000 feet:
        That is the highest elevation of the road, and often around the elevation you park at.
        If it&apos;s higher, you can still have good skiing, but you are going to have to
        pay the toll of climbing through the rain line to get it.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Solar input</h3>
      <p>
        The sun has less effect in Alaska than you might be used to if you are coming from
        more equatorial areas, and it is less focused.
        In other areas, in the middle of winter (Dec to Feb), you often need to be aware of how
        the sun is affecting the snow. Even if it isn&apos;t warming it enough to cause wet slides,
        it still could be causing melt-freeze crusts, etc.
        In Turnagain Pass, unless there are exposed rocks to absorb the heat, or it&apos;s a very warm
        day, I usually don&apos;t think about the solar input that much until the springtime.
        If it&apos;s a super sunny pow day in January, as long as it&apos;s fairly cold I wouldn&apos;t
        write off skiing a direct South line.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weak solar input is caused by several things:
        First, until around the equinox on March 21,
        Alaska gets fewer hours of daylight than further south.
        Second, the orbits the horizon instead of arcing straight overhead,
        which generally leads to any one patch of snow being hit by direct sun for a smaller
        fraction of the day.
        Third, it&apos;s a lot cloudier than Colorado.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Radiative Cooling</h3>
      <p>
        The &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; of solar input is radiative cooling.
        This is when the snow emits UV radiation that travels through a clear sky
        and makes it out to space, taking thermal energy with it.
        This clear sky is important: on a cloudy day, the UV radiation hits the clouds,
        the clouds absorb it, the clouds heat up a tiny bit,
        and then the clouds emit UV radiation of their own, which travels back to the ground,
        where the snow absorbs it, regaining the energy that they gave away at the beginning.
        This is similar to on a cold autumn morning when the ground exposed to the sky is frosty,
        but any ground covered by vegetation or a tent fly is not frosty: both bits of ground
        emitted the same amount of UV radiation, but the UV from the covered ground got absorbed
        and re-emitted by the covering object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turnagain Pass often has less radiative cooling effect than other areas,
        because we are so cloudy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Radiative cooling really is important for the corn cycle that happens in the spring.
        To make corn snow, the top few inches of the snow needs to melt during a warm
        day, and then freeze solid at night.
        Around here, because of the moderately warm ambient air temperatures,
        the freezing at night often requires a clear sky.
        We can have bad corn seasons when we don&apos;t get those clear skies consitently:
        the snow melts during the warm day, but then sort of just stays as slop at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, this radiative cooling has the most effect at night,
        but it can also be significant during a clear day if you are in a shadowy north-facing zone.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Common Patterns</h3>
      <p>There are several common patterns that the weather follows.</p>
      
      <h4>Gulf Storm</h4>
      <p>
        A storm system comes from the Gulf of Alaska and hits Turnagain Pass from the West,
        spilling over Portage Pass from Prince William Sound.
        This is the most common storm system that gives Turnagain Pass snow.
        When this happens, the areas that are favored for precipitation are Portage
        (not covered in this guide) and the North end of the Pass.
        Because this is the most common, this is reason why in general the snowpack
        is deeper on the North end of the Pass than the South end.
        These storms can sometimes just sit on Turnagain Pass and DUMP precipitation for
        5 days straight.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Cook Inlet Storms</h4>
      <p>
        These storms move up Cook Inlet and come over the Kenai Mountains to hit Turnagain Pass
        from the Southeast. These storms are more rare than the Gulf Storms.
        When this happens, the Seward and Summit Lake areas (not in this guide) are favored
        with precipitation, as well as the South end of the pass, where the North end of the
        pass is skipped.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Northern Outflows</h4>
      <p>
        Oftentimes a high pressure system from the center of alaska flows South past Anchorage
        and down Turnagain Arm, blasting Turnagain Pass with high winds at first,
        which then settle into a period of clear and cold weather.
        It&apos;s a bummer when these happen too strongly, because the initial winds
        can ruin the snow from the previous storm, and then you are stuck with this
        beautiful weather but a bunch of terrible snow.
        When this system moves in with less wind, then this pattern can make for
        excellent riding conditions.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Snowpack and Avalanches</h2>
      <p>
        Turnagain Pass has a maritime snowpack, receiving hundreds of inches of
        snow (and often, rain) a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The local avalanche center is
        <a href="https://www.cnfaic.org/forecast/turnagain/"> CNFAIC</a>
        (Chugach National Forest Avalanche Information Center).
      </p>
      
      <h3>Ground Hoar</h3>
      <p>
        We don&apos;t usually get it. Hurray! So that means we don&apos;t usually have to
        worry about avalanches breaking at the ground.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Glide Cracks</h3>
      <p>
        We DO have a hazard that is a lot less common in other zones: glide cracks.
        This is when the entire snowpack creeps along the ground, and a glide crack appears
        where sections separate.
        They are more likely to be active during warm periods and rain, but they can
        still be active at other times too.
      </p>
      <p>
        They present as a 1-10 foot wide gap in the snowpack that is open all the
        way to the ground below, which can sometimes be 10 or 15 feet below.
        This is one hazard of them: if you are careless or if the visibility is bad,
        you can ski off a non-insignificant temporary cliff!
      </p>
      <p>
        They also are hazards when they release as catastrophic avalanches.
        This actually is pretty rare, most glide cracks we see become inactive
        and then new snow fills in the crack.
        But when they do release, they release usually to the ground, and very large.
        Usually you can&apos;t trigger them yourself, but you just want to minimize
        your exposure by not lingering underneath them.
      </p>
      <p>In general</p>
      <ul>
        <li>try to avoid them if you can</li>
        <li>be especially cautious in bad visibility</li>
        <li>
          if there is no better route, I wouldn&apos;t think it was crazy to quickly scoot
          around them
        </li>
      </ul>
