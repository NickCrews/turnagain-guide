        you enter the Taylor Creek hanging valley.
        Then go right (South) across the Taylor Creek drainage over to the base
        of the Northeast Ridge of Magnum.
        Much of this ridge is skinnable, but it often requires a touch of bootpacking at the top where
        it is steepest and often wind-board.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrain on this ridge slowly gets steeper the higher you go.
        This is nice, because you can skin as high as you are comfortable with,
        and then drop off the West side (straight towards the parking lot)
        onto the <RouteLink routeID="magnum-front-face">Magnum Front Face</RouteLink>
        when you reach your limit.
        In low-snow conditions, the alders can be too much, and you may want to reverse
        your route back down the Northeast Ridge.
