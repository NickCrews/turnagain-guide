# About

## Goals

### Free and Open
This is your public land. Info on it should be public too.
Discussion on how to improve it is welcome, and should be public.
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NickCrews/turnagain-guide-next).

### Community Driven
Please get in touch at *nicholas.b.crews+turnagain.guide@gmail.com*.
I would love corrections, suggestions, or to hear what has been
working for you and what hasn't.
The help of many will polish this to it's best version.
Note that I reserve the right to make final decisions (for now)

### Useful
Maps, descriptions, etc can actually help you plan a trip.
eg where is good for a storm day? What are your exit options
for high-avalanche danger day?

### Digital-first
We can do better than book-only guidebooks.
We have PDF export for offline use and printing, of course.
But just as good is a website, allowing for
- search
- interactive maps
- links and external resources
- live conditions
- realtime corrections and updates
- etc.
