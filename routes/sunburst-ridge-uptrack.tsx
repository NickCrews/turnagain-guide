      <p>
        A very popular ascent route to access the Sunburst Ridge.
        This is a fast and efficient skin.
        It's possible to lap a lot of excellent skiing using this uptrack.
        Start from the top of the <RouteLink routeID="sunburst-meadows-uptrack">
        Sunburst Meadows Uptrack</RouteLink>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few rollovers at the top where I like to space out
        with my partner while skinning, but mostly this is fairly safe from avalanches.
        There are probably lots of other people using this route, so them
        above you is probably the biggest danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't have to go all the way to the top.
        Anywhere off the South side of the ridge is good skiing,
        stop wherever you see a line you like.
      </p>
