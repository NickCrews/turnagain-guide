If you are at the bottom of [Tincan Trees](./tincan-trees), there is also a deproach track that takes
you back to the parking lot with only minimal scooching along a few flat meadows.

This is the most popular way to deproach Tincan.
The alternative is to reverse the [main uptrack](./tincan-uptrack), skiing down the ridge the whole way.
This is the most surefire way to get back to the parking lot, but it is also the least fun.

The benefit of this route is that it allows for slightly better skiing
through Tincan Trees on your last descent; the skiing down the ridge is slightly worse.
The downside of this route is that it can be confusing if you don't know where
you are going.
Usually you will find a track from others before you,
although if it hasn't snowed recently these tracks can become a maze
of people skiing and skinning in all different directions.
If you follow the GPS track you will be fine.
