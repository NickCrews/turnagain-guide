This is the obvious, huge, steep NW facing bowl on the North side of Tincan ridge
that you see as drive up the pass from Anchorage.
It is named after [Todd Frankiewicz, who died in an avalanche on December 6th, 1988](https://www.akmountain.com/2021/04/13/tincan-peak-north-ridge/).
It often avalanches naturally, and has a steep and committing entrance that makes it
hard to enter safely.
When it is safe though, it is an excellent steep run.
You get here by skinning the main uptrack to the top, and then booting back along the
ridge until you get to the dropin.
