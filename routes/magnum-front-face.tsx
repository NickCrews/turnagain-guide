      <p>
        Early and late season this is an alder-covered hellscape.
        But come mid-season, once the alders are down, there is a lot of fun to be had here.
        There are also plenty of steeps and rollovers that can get windloaded,
        at the top.
        If you want some fun dad pow though, you can totally lap the lower
        half of the face and never get into anything too steep.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the looker&apos;s left side of this face is
        the <RouteLink routeID="magnum-northeast-ridge">Magnum Northeast Ridge</RouteLink>,
        which is a great way to lap this face.
      </p>
