      <p>
        This is the early season route that is required when the alders are exposed.
        During mid and late season, you should use
        the <RouteLink routeID="sunburst-meadows-uptrack">
          Regular Season Uptrack</RouteLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start from the parking lot by heading North along the road for a hundred
        yards until you reach the first meadow, at which point turn right (East)
        and head towards Sunburst.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the top of this route, just before joining the regular route, there is an
        icy gully that can be unpleasant to navigate.
        See the linked photo. Most people go straight up it,
        which often requires clicking out of your skis/boards to boot,
        but there is actually a way to sneak around it via a meadow on the left
        that allows you to keep your skins on.
