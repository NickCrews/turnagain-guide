Cross the parking lot meadow and then head basically up the fall line to the ridge,
and then continue following that. See the GPS track.
You will almost always have some track to follow.

The skintrack is generally low angle and fairly easy.
It continues all the way to very near the sumimit, the starting point of Tincan Common.
You are out of large-scale avalanche terrain the entire time.
There are a few small but steep rollovers that I might be concerned
about on the highest danger days, but in general it is very safe.
If it's a high danger but good weather, a very nice route is
to skin all the way to the top of Tincan Common, enjoy the awesome views,
and ski right back down the skintrack.
