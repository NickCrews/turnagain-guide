Eddies is an area with many low angle options, some steeper runs,
and if you keep going back the ridge, some ski movie spines.
The downsides of eddies are the 40 minute approach through the woods,
and the slightly lower elevation.
If it weren't for these two downsides, I bet this would be just as popular of an area
as <Link href={"/routes/tincan-area"}> Tincan</Link>.
