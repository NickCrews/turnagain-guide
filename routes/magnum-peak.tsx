        This isn&apos;t truly a peak, but is the logical high point for riding down.

        You can have a mellow ski back down the ridge to the top
        of <RouteLink routeID="pms-bowl-uptrack">PMS Bowl</RouteLink>,
        or drop Southwest onto the steeper Southwest Face.
      </p>

        The skiing off the North side of the ridge is usually wind scoured and not good.
