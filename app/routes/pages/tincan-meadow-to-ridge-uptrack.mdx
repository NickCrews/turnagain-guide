If you ski the Western part of [Tincan Trees](./tincan-trees), you end up downhill
of the [Tincan Trees Uptrack](./tincan-trees-uptrack), so if you want to get
back uphill, this is the easiest way to do it. This drops you off back on
the main [Tincan Uptrack](./tincan-uptrack) after a few hundred vertical feet
through a tight meadow through dense woods. On the highest avy danger storm days,
there is one tight gully that you may need to skin around, but 98% of the time
there is nothing to worry about.
