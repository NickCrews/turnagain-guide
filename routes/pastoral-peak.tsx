    <p>
      This is one of the highest peaks in the area, and a great viewpoint.
      It's a long tour, and the ratio of effort to skiing isn't as good
      as some alternatives, but the views and the adventure make it worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common approach is to park at
      the <RouteLink routeID="sunburst-parking-lot">Sunburst Parking Lot</RouteLink> and
      tour up the Taylor Creek drainage up to Taylor Pass, then continue
      along the <RouteLink routeID="taylor-pass-to-pastoral-peak">north bowl
      and up to the peak</RouteLink>.
