Sometimes plowed.
If you want to go up Seattle Ridge, sometimes called "sunnyside",
this is the best parking lot for that.
The entire West side of the Seward Highway is open to motorized vehicles,
so you will be sharing the terrain with lots of snowmachines.
During the middle of the season they will have ripped up a lot of the
ridable snow.
But early season, before the Forest Service opens the area to snowmachines,
it can be a great place to find some sunny powder through the alder fields
of Seattle Ridge.
