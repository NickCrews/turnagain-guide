    <p>
      Sharksfin is the small, skinny, and long ridge to the North of Eddies.
      It isn&apos;t very popular because there is no easy trail to get there.
      The best way is to start at
      the <RouteLink routeID="eddies-parking-lot">Eddies Parking Lot</RouteLink> and
      start up the
      regular <RouteLink routeID="eddies-approach-and-uptrack">Eddies Uptrack</RouteLink> before
      at some point cutting left (North) over to Sharksfin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven&apos;t actually been there myself and I&apos;m not sure what the
      terrain and riding is like.
