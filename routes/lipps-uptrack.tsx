      <p>
        Start from the <RouteLink routeID="lipps-parking-lot">Lipps Parking Lot</RouteLink>,
        cross the road (East, towards Lipps) and turn left (South)
        and walk along the highway shoulder for 300 m until you can head left (East)
        up a drainage that provides a break in the trees.
        This can be filled with alders in early and late season.
        At this South end of the Pass you are starting a few hundred feet lower
        than at the summit near Tincan, so there can often be a large difference in
        snow conditions and alder coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fight your way through some alders for 15 minutes until you break out into
        the wid open alder fields at the bottom of Lipps.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get to the summit you need to expose yourself to some serious
        avalanche terrain. The face is wide, steep, the runout is not great,
        and it's hard to avoid being under people above you.
        The best way up is the South side of the face.
        Aim in that direction as you switchback your way up through the
        alder meadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you descend, you probably want to exit to the road exactly how
        you came up.
        When whooping down the fun low-angle meadows, it can
        be tempting to drift right (North), but if you do that you will end up in
        an alder filled gully (we call it a &quot;stunt ditch&quot; because that's fun)
        that is possible to navigate but requires gymnastics.
