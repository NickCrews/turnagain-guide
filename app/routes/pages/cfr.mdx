This goes from the summit of Tincan Common down the NW ridge,
the lefthand skyline when looking at Tincan from the parking lot.
This often is wind-affected, but when it has good snow, it is a
long, consistent, fairly safe run that is often overlooked and untouched.
I've only skied it once, usually I opt for lapping Tincan Common,
but it is a nice alternative to have in your back pocket.
