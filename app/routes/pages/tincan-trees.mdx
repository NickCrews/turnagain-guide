The meadows on the north side of the ridge are known as "Tincan Trees".
The terrain is composed of many small lumps and rollovers, with a mix of open meadows
and dense stands of trees, with tight passages connecting the meadows.
There are many complex mini drainages and ridges, so if you are adventurous you can
often find less-touched snow if you venture out of the obvious runs.
The laps are fairly short, maybe 800 vertical feet, but the uptrack is easy
so it doesn't feel totally stupid.

If the weather is stormy, Tincan is one of the better options in Turnagain pass.
This area has enough trees to provide visual contrast,
where many other areas would be whiteout conditions.

It is fairly easy to stay in low angle terrain, out of avalanche terrain,
but if you are careless it also is very possible to ski over a small
but steep and abrupt rollover and trigger a slide in high avalanche conditions,
eg if you are skiing in the middle of a storm.
These would be small, but with terrain traps, or if your partners aren't watching you,
it could be serious.
On many storm days I have seen small slides triggered in this zone.
