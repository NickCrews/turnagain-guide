name: Build static site as a test
# This workflow merely builds the static site to ensure that is possible,
# as a very basic sanity check.
# I actually deploy the site from the cloudflare dashboard,
# where I have the build configured to re-build on every push to main.

# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
