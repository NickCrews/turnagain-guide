      <p>
        If you are at the bottom of{" "}
        <RouteLink routeID="tincan-trees">Tincan Trees</RouteLink>, there is
        also a deproach track that takes you back to the parking lot with only
        minimal scooching along a few flat meadows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the most popular way to deproach Tincan. The alternative is to
        reverse the [main uptrack](./tincan-uptrack), skiing down the ridge the
        whole way. This is the most surefire way to get back to the parking lot,
        but it is also the least fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The benefit of this route is that it allows for slightly better skiing
        through Tincan Trees on your last descent; the skiing down the ridge is
        slightly worse. The downside of this route is that it can be confusing
        if you don&apos;t know where you are going. Usually you will find a track
        from others before you, although if it hasn&apos;t snowed recently these
        tracks can become a maze of people skiing and skinning in all different
        directions. If you follow the GPS track you will be fine.
