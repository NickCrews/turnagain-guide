      <p>
        A large, off-highway parking lot. This is most often used if you are
        planning on descending from
        <RouteLink routeID="the-libraries">The Libraries</RouteLink>,
        <RouteLink routeID="tincan-hippie-bowl">Hippy Bowl</RouteLink>, or
        somewhere else up center ridge valley, because it&apos;s all down hill to
        here when skiing down center ridge valley. It&apos;s just a little bit harder
        to get back to
        <RouteLink routeID="tincan-parking-lot">Tincan Parking Lot</RouteLink>
        from center ridge valley, requiring a bit of sidestepping (if you are on
        skis and there is already a track), or a tiny skin if you are on a
        splitboard or the snow is deep.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are bathrooms here, but they are usually closed in winter. After a
        big storm, this is one of the later parking lots to get plowed. This is
        also a common parking lot for snowmachiners, who overflow here when
        their main parking lot across the highway is full.
