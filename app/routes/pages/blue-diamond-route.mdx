Leads from [Center Ridge Parking Lot](./center-ridge-parking-lot) up to
join the [Tincan Uptrack](./tincan-uptrack) about halfway to treeline.
It's a slightly easier skin and ski than the lower half of the [Tincan Uptrack](./tincan-uptrack).
I like to do it when going with my mom, but otherwise most people
generally prefer starting at the [Tincan Parking Lot](./tincan-parking-lot)
since it allows for you to ski the [Tincan Trees](./tincan-trees) on the way back
to the car.
