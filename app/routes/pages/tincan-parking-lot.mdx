title: Tincan Parking Lot
---

There is a pulloff on the East side of the highway, on the outside of a curve.
It is one of the better-plowed parking lots in Turnagain pass,
usually plowed either during or the day after a storm.

This is a dangerous parking lot. In 2021,
[a semi truck pancaked three cars](https://www.facebook.com/girdwoodfire/posts/pfbid02Cvg6hsHWwZrx4UuUmifkT5sgELemarYChwvnCgJ5v4qByyf5NLgD84THEgcJrVYWl)
that were parked in the lot.
I try to not linger in the parking lot for very long after I park,
and put on my gear near the guardrail where I am at least marginally protected
by the parked cars.

Once you park, it's a chaotic scramble/slide down the embankment and across the meadow.
On the far side of a meadow, CNFAIC usually has a beacon checker machine.
Slide past it one at a time to verify that your beacon is working.

If you want a break from downhill skiing, on a clear day it is fun to nordic ski
North through these meadows.
You go gradually uphill until you reach a crest where
you are treated to a beautiful view down the length of the whole of Turnagain Pass,
all the way down to Turnagain Arm 1000 feet below.
You better watch out though, or you might run into a roving band of retired ladies
from Girdwood drinking gin and tonics and eating cake for someone's birthday.

Very very rarely is the parking lot so full that there is no room.
When this happens, choose a different zone, or continue South up the highway
to the Center Ridge parking lot, and you can access the Tincan ridge from the slightly
longer and lower quality "Blue Diamond" approach trail.
